# WDI Project 2: Travel app 

## User Stories
* User will land on a landing page that asks him for a user login/password or allows him to sign up
* User will then be redirected into the main page where he will see a big map and a navigation bar with multiple options:
	*	a link to a list of every country with information about the country
	* a link to the trips he/she has made
	* a link to a list of places he/she wants to visit
	* a link to go back to main page, and one to logout
	*	Both databases will be joined by the city in common 
*	The user should be able to add a new item to each list, entering a description and date visited
*	When clicking on each item list he/she should be directed to a show page where they will be able to update a particular item on the list or delete it
	*Likewise for the “Places I want to visit” 
*	The map on the main page should mark the places visited by the user
